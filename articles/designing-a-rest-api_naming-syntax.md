## Introduction

This article is the first in a series of some great takeaways on how to craft a well-designed REST API. As 
you read through the articles you will learn how to form an API in a way that is easy to expand, document and use.

The articles will not cover implementation details(eg. no code samples) but any suggestions given here will be possible 
to implement in any proper framework like Spring Boot, .Net Core MVC, Expressjs or others.

The things you can expect to get from these articles are these:

1: Naming convention (This article)
2: Recognizable design pattern (Future article)
3: Versioning (Future article)
4: Paging and sorting (Future article)
5: Searching (Future article)
6: Authentication (Future article)
7: Patching (Future article)
8: Documentation (Future article)

Thats the overview. Let's get started looking at the naming convention.

## Casing conventions
Something about whether to use PascalCase, camelPascal, snake_case or kebab-case.

## Plural or Singular

## Matching with Entity names
